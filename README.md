# Project_0

The goal of Project 0 is to create a basic user/item management application. The app includes at least three database tables with a PK/FK relationship between them. Users and books, with every book belonging to one user. Imagine that this app is for admins managing the users and the items, not for the actual users themselves. 

Tech Requirements 

Data will be stored in a PostgreSQL Database 

The Java API sends SQL queries to the Database via JDBC. 

The Java API uses Javalin to process HTTP Requests 

HTTP Requests are sent via Postman. 

I highly suggest regularly pushing your code to a GitHub repo!! Not only is it great practice, but it’s a good way to save your work as you go. 

 

User Stories  

Users of the application can: 

Select all items from the items table ! 

Select all that belong to a certain user (find items by user id)! 

Insert a new item into the items table! 

Insert a new user into the users table ! 

Update a user 

Delete an item 

[A functionality of your choice – must be a CRUD operation or cooler] 

If you implement login, that will satisfy this requirement
